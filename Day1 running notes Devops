https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control
 
 *need to have clear idea about  workflow 
 *dev-ops eng will merge programs on server 
 
 VCS /SVN (Source code  managment )
 
   1.Centralized  server /SVN
    
    *  to connect  to centralized  server  always Network connection  to repository is mandatory 
    * at end project only one copy would be generated 
    Disadvantages : 
     * No version / backups would  be  provided 
   If a  Dev- ops  engineer  opt  for SVN / centralized    they should have 

      (1) Backup  copy-  would be done perodically
      (2)mirror copy - 	 Instantly 

   2.distributed  server    
   
     A main  server   would  have  space allocations  for   all departments    and git also need to be installed in  every ones computer  
	  all cmputer would  have an update 
	  Devleoper  also  need  have lgit   at in his system 
	   
	   server and logger copy is must 
	   Advantage all will have  updated  code using hash  code  technique   they compresss
	   
  
  A project folder   --------------------------> server (local GIT)---------------------------------->server  (git / github)
  
    to move a file    from folder to    intaizse  to stagging area  using command ----> " GIT ADD"
	
	  To  push file   from 
	  
	   * create a folder /directory  on Loacl computer  
	   * create files 
	   * add contents(contents is placed in  files)
	   * We need to intalize
	   * we use  command "GIT  ADD"
       * we  need   to commit " GIT COMMIT"
